# How to write copy

## Parser Contract

`emails_v2.md` (and `emails.md`) must follow a fixed structure so downstream campaign tooling can parse them reliably. Hard rules this skill must honor:

- `## Email N: {Descriptive Title}` - the title becomes the EmailBison step name (truncated to 25 chars). Missing title → step name falls back to `Variant A`.
- `### Variant A (desc)` / `### Variant B (desc)` - literal word `Variant`, never `Version` (parser warns on `Version`). Letter in `A..D`. Parenthetical description becomes the step-name suffix.
- Combined step name `{title} - {variant_desc}` must be ≤25 chars. Longer strings get truncated - authors should pre-shorten to preserve intent.
- AI variables use double braces `{{Title Case}}` (uppercase-first required): `{{First Line}}`, `{{PS Line}}`, `{{Subject Line}}`. This is the canonical form and is exactly what Ken AI stores and renders on push. (Legacy `[Title Case]` square brackets are still auto-converted, but write `{{...}}` in all new copy.)
- Lead variables use `{camelCase}`: `{firstName}`, `{company}`. Never `{first_name}`.
- Signatures use the system variable `{sender_signature}` (single braces) in place of any hand-written sign-off - on every email. See the Signature rule below.
- Never write `{{tracking_link:...}}` in local copy - the parser inserts them.
- End the file with a terminator H2 (`## Notes`, `## Signature Block`, `## AI Personalization Placeholders`) so trailing metadata doesn't get swallowed into the last email's body. Also supported: `**Variant Notes**:` / `**Test Notes**:` inline markers.
- Every AI variable used (e.g. `{{First Line}}`) must have a matching H3 in `prompts.md`. `{{Subject Line}}` is the exception you don't have to write: the parser auto-emits a Subject Line output prompt for it (kept `to_rewrite=0`, so it's generated but never rewritten). It is **not** backend-provided - that missing prompt is what broke workflow start on 2026-06-03 - so add a `### Subject Line` H3 only when you want to override the default.

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for writing effective cold email copy. Use this skill when creating email sequences, writing cold outreach, or reviewing email campaigns. Claude should reference these guidelines whenever writing or reviewing cold email copy.

**Campaign Strategy Integration:** When the user provides a Campaign Strategy document (containing an email sequence blueprint and AI variables), this skill consumes that input to write the actual email copy and generate the corresponding AI personalization prompts.

## Variable Naming Contract

Authors write AI variables, lead variables, and the signature variable **directly in their final form**. Only links convert downstream.

| Type | Syntax | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| Lead variable | `{camelCase}` single braces | `{firstName}`, `{company}`, `{title}` |
| AI variable | `{{Title Case}}` double braces | `{{Subject Line}}`, `{{First Line}}`, `{{PS Line}}`, `{{Final PS Line}}` |
| Signature | `{sender_signature}` single-brace system variable | one per email, in place of the sign-off |
| Sender name | `{sender_first_name}` / `{sender_last_name}` single-brace system variables | optional, when you reference the sender by name in the body |
| Link | Raw transparent URL or markdown link | `https://...` → parser inserts `{{tracking_link:ID}}` |

**Rules:**
- **AI variables use double braces `{{Title Case}}`** - this is exactly what Ken AI stores and renders, so write it directly (it is required "for correct rendering in the app when you push it"). Use `{{Subject Line}}`, `{{First Line}}`, `{{PS Line}}`, `{{Final PS Line}}`. Never `{{first_line}}`, `{{Subject line}}`, or alternate spellings. The legacy `[Title Case]` square-bracket form still auto-converts so old files keep working, but do not author new variables that way.
- Lead variables use camelCase: `{firstName}`, `{company}`, `{title}`. Never `{first_name}` or `{company_name}`.
- **Signatures use `{sender_signature}`** on every email - see the Signature rule. Never hand-write the closer, name, and title as a literal signature. `{sender_first_name}` and `{sender_last_name}` are also available if you need to name the sender inside the body (they resolve to the sending mailbox at launch). Full list in [`references/lead-variables.md`](references/lead-variables.md).
- Links: write raw transparent URLs or markdown links. Never write `{{tracking_link:ID}}` or any tracking placeholder in local copy.

## Execution Tasks

**Execute these tasks in order. Do NOT skip any task unless noted.**

### Task 1: Load Context
- [ ] Read `{workspace}/research.md` - ICP, value proposition, messaging themes, product info, case studies
- [ ] Read `{segment_folder}/strategy.md` (if workflow mode) - Email sequence blueprint
- [ ] Read `{workspace}/notes.md` (if exists) - Client-specific preferences
- [ ] Read `references/lead-variables.md` - Correct lead variable names and syntax

### Task 2: Check for A/B Tests
- [ ] Search strategy.md for `## Sequence Tests` section
- [ ] If found: Note which emails need variants and what varies

### Task 3: Generate Draft Email Copy
- [ ] Read `email_copywriting.md` for tactical guidance
- [ ] Write initial email sequence following strategy blueprint
- [ ] Insert AI variable placeholders where specified (e.g., `{{First Line}}`)
- [ ] Create variants if A/B test defined

### Task 4: Output Final Copy
- [ ] Write `emails.md` to campaign folder (workflow mode) OR return inline (standalone)
- [ ] Confirm to user where files are saved

---

## Required Context

Before writing email copy, always load the client context:

1. **Read `{workspace}/research.md`** - Get ICP, value proposition, messaging themes, detailed product info, case studies, and outbound angles
2. **Read `{workspace}/notes.md`** (if it exists) - Client-specific preferences

**Directory Structure Reference** (`{workspace}` = the client campaign workspace):
```
{workspace}/
├── research.md       # Client research - ICP, value prop, key contacts
├── notes.md          # Optional client preferences
└── {date} - {plan-name}/          # Plan folder (shared files)
    ├── plan.md                     # Campaign plan
    ├── filters.json                # List building filters
    ├── qualification.md            # Qualification criteria
    ├── segmentation.md             # Segmentation criteria
    └── {n} - {segment-slug}/       # Segment folder (per-segment files)
        ├── strategy.md             # Email sequence blueprint
        ├── emails.md               # Email copy
        ├── emails_v2.md            # Reviewed email copy
        └── prompts.md              # AI personalization prompts
```

## A/B Test Detection

Before writing emails, check if strategy.md contains a "Sequence Tests" section:

1. **Read strategy.md** looking for `## Sequence Tests`
2. **If found**, identify:
   - Which emails need variants (from "Affected Emails")
   - What varies between Variant A and Variant B
   - The implementation instructions
3. **Write variant emails** in emails.md for affected emails only
4. **Unaffected emails** remain single-variant (normal format)

When sequence tests exist, the email-copywriting skill must produce variant emails that match the test definition from strategy.md.

**A/B variants are NOT limited to Email 1.** Add variants to follow-up emails whenever there is a worth-testing hook there too - for example a proof-led follow-up vs a low-friction "just drop into one session" energy framing, or two different pain points in a bump. Don't default to testing only the first email. If a follow-up has a meaningfully different angle worth measuring, give it Variant A / Variant B as well (same Variant heading rules and ≤25 char step-name limit apply).

## Principles
_The state of mind when you write_
### Core Philosophy
Contrary to what many people think, email copy is more about **what you say** than how you say it. Many focus on using or avoiding specific words, avoiding questions, or eliminating "passive language." But it's not about those rules - it's about:

*   **Who you're targeting** (ICP)
*   **What you're telling them** (value proposition, pain point)
*   **What you're offering** (offer)
*   **What happens next** (CTA & funnel)

In your copy, your main job is to determine which combination of these 4 will work best - not to fixate on the exact wording.
### Golden Rule
> "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."
*   Write emails they would want to receive
*   Ask yourself: Would you reply/click if you'd receive this email?
### Write Like a Human
*   Write like you talk
*   Don't follow sales & marketing patterns
*   Write like an excited team mate just wrote to you about this cool new idea
### Make It Interesting
*   Don't be boring
*   Make them want to read it
*   **Quality hierarchy:** Long interesting copy > short interesting copy > short boring copy > long boring copy
*   Make them learn new interesting stuff
### Keep It Simple
*   Humans are lazy
*   Don't make them think too much, or put too much effort
*   Write at the level 90% of your audience would understand (Simple > fancy)
*   Make it easy to do the CTA you want them to do
*   Only 1 CTA and 1 idea per email

## Critical Copy Rules

These rules are **non-negotiable** and must be followed in every email sequence.

### Transitions (Smooth First-Line Bridge - CRITICAL)
- **Never have abrupt transitions** from personalized first line to body content. This is a top failure mode.
- When an email opens with an AI-personalized `{{First Line}}`, the first sentence of static body **MUST continue that thought**. Never jump from a personalized line straight into a generic statement like "Scaling a SaaS company..." - that abrupt jump reads like two unrelated emails stitched together.
- Design the `{{First Line}}` prompt to **end on a bridge** that the static body completes. The body's opening sentence should read as the natural next beat of the personalized line, not a topic change.
- Add transitional context or ensure the first line topic connects to the body.

### Greetings (Every Email)
- **Every email in the sequence, including follow-ups, MUST open with a greeting** - `Hey {firstName},`
- Follow-ups that jump straight into the body with no greeting are wrong, even though they thread off Email 1.
- The greeting is always followed by an empty line, then the `{{First Line}}` or body.

### Spam Words & False Claims
- **Never use the words "free" or "credit card" in body copy.** Both hurt deliverability. Reframe: instead of "free trial" use "trial" or "no-cost look"; instead of "no credit card required" just describe how fast they can start.
- **Never make an offer claim that is not true.** If a card is actually required, do not say "no credit card." If a trial has limits, do not imply it is unlimited. Every claim must be verifiable against the client's actual offer in `{workspace}/research.md`.
- See `email_copywriting.md` for the full spam-word list inherited from QA.

### Brevity & Punch (HARD - the #1 recurring failure)
- **The default draft is always too long.** Operator feedback, repeatedly: even copy that went through the full review workflow still ships too long. Cut harder than feels natural - assume your first instinct is 30%+ over.
- **Hard ceiling: each email's static body is ≤80 words** (body = prose + CTA, not counting the greeting, the AI-variable lines, or `{sender_signature}`). Tighter is better. The first email may sit near the ceiling because it carries the offer; follow-ups should land well under it (aim ≤55 words).
- After drafting, run a mandatory "cut at least 30%" pass: delete every word not earning its place, every restated idea, every throat-clearing clause. Then count the body words and confirm it is under the ceiling before moving on.
- **Punchy, not staccato.** Punchy means lean and direct. It does NOT mean one-sentence-per-line fragments ("It just runs.") - those read jittery and AI-generated. Keep full thoughts and group related ideas into a paragraph; break only when the beat genuinely changes. Target one or two short paragraphs plus the CTA.
- Remember AI personalization adds 1-2 sentences on top of the static body, so keep the static copy tight enough that the rendered email still breathes.

### Signature (Use `{sender_signature}` - HARD)
- **Every email signs off with the single token `{sender_signature}` on its own line, in place of the closer + name + title.** Do not hand-write "Best,", "Cheers,", the sender's name, their title, or a tagline as a literal signature. The sending inbox owns its signature and injects it through this variable, which keeps multi-inbox / multi-sender sends consistent and lets sender identity vary at the inbox layer.
- Placement: `{sender_signature}` goes where the sign-off was, after the CTA. A PS variable (`{{PS Line}}`, `{{Final PS Line}}`) goes on its own line **after** `{sender_signature}`.
- This replaces the older "social-proof signature block" guidance. Put credibility in the body, not in a hand-typed signature.

### Sequence Length (Default to 3)
- **Default toward a 3-email sequence, not 4-5.** More emails is not better.
- Only go beyond 3 when the strategy gives each extra email a distinct, worth-sending idea (e.g. a new proof point or angle). If a 4th or 5th email just restates earlier ones, cut it.

### Subject Line Threading
- **Email 1**: Use AI-generated subject line as default (unless testing a specific static alternative)
- **Follow-up emails (2-5+)**: Leave subject line empty to maintain threading
- Threads are the preferred approach for email sequences

### Language to Avoid
Never use these phrases or patterns:
- "Quick followup", "quick question", "touching base"
- "No worries if timing isn't right" (or any apologetic/defensive language)
- "Quick insight:" prefix - just state the insight directly
- Any typical sales clichés that scream "cold email"

**Final-email endings (HARD).** The last email in a sequence must NOT announce itself as a follow-up or a last attempt. Never use "Last note from me", "Last email", "Just following up", "Following up", "Circling back", "Checking in", "Wanted to follow up", "Bumping this", or "One last try". These are the salesy endings operators flag most, and they keep slipping through - the email-review skill rejects them. The final email earns its open with a real idea or value beat and closes on the offer CTA; it never leans on the fact that it is a follow-up.

### Formatting Requirements
- **Short paragraphs only**: 1-3 sentences max per paragraph
- **Add spacing** between thoughts - AI personalization adds 1-2 sentences, so keep body concise with breathing room
- **Never use ALL CAPS** for emphasis - use structure or italics instead

### First Email Requirements
- **MUST mention the solution**, not just the problem
- State the problem AND offer the solution in the same email
- Don't ask if they have problems - state their problem and offer solution
- **State UVP clearly** in first email - don't keep your value prop secret

### Pain Point Testing
- **Don't assume the first pain point is the best.** The opening pain you reach for is rarely the winner.
- Propose **several candidate pain points** for the ICP and test them - e.g. as Email 1 opener variants (Variant A vs Variant B) rather than committing to one.
- When you list candidates, note which pain each variant leads with so the A/B result tells you which pain resonates, not just which wording.

### CTA Requirements
- **Every email's CTA asks for the actual offer - including Email 1.** Whatever the campaign sells (a walkthrough, a demo, a call, a sample), every email closes by asking for that. The first email must lead with the strongest, most direct version of the offer CTA, not a soft warm-up. The most powerful CTA belongs in the first email, not held back for later.
- **Diagnostic / soft questions are NOT CTAs.** Asking about the prospect's situation does not count. Banned as CTAs: "Do you have a system for X?", "Do you have anything in place?", "Where do your clients come from?", "Is it worth a look?", "a quick look", "Curious if...?", "Worth exploring...?". They ask about *them* instead of asking for the meeting, and they consistently underperform. Replace every one with a direct ask for the offer.
- Make CTAs **strong, direct, and specific to the offer** - e.g. "Want me to walk you through how it works?", "Open to a quick walkthrough?", "Want me to show you how it'd run for your {company}?". For SaaS-style calls, position as a "strategy call" or "conversion optimization call".
- Never use "Should I close the loop?" - instead: "Reply if you'd like me to stop emailing"
- Don't ask complex rhetorical questions that require too much thought. Yes/no (or either/or) only.
- **No time commitments in the CTA** - duration ("30 minutes", "15 min") surfaces on the call, never in the CTA line.
- **Preferred CTA pattern (question + link on its own line):** a strong CTA can be a short direct question with the link on the very next line by itself, rather than burying the link inside a sentence. This reads cleaner and lifts clicks:
  ```
  Do you want to apply?

  https://example.com/apply
  ```
  Other good questions: "Want a seat?", "Want the breakdown?" Keep the question to a few words and put the raw transparent URL on its own line directly below.

### Rhetorical Questions
- If using rhetorical questions like "What if your site could guide them?", you **MUST** immediately follow with the answer/solution
- Never leave prospects hanging - rhetorical questions need payoff in the next sentence

### Offer Strategy (Mid-Market)
- **Sell the PRODUCT**, not audits/analysis/friction analysis
- Mid-market companies need solutions, not indie hacker-style audits
- Friction analysis can be mentioned as proof/demo, but not as the primary offer
- Offer should be: "See how [Product] monitors X automatically" not "Get a free audit"

### Case Study Relevance
- **Match proof points to prospect's vertical** - don't use irrelevant case studies
- Examples: Don't mention Crocs or consumer brands to B2B SaaS prospects
- Use case studies from same or adjacent industries
- If no relevant case study exists, use a generic metric without naming the company

## Output Format

### File Structure
When creating or improving email copy, output **three separate files**:

**IMPORTANT - Do NOT Include These Sections in emails.md:**
- ~~Compliance Notes~~ (handled separately by CSM/EmailBison)
- ~~QA Checklist~~ (internal process, not for output file)

Keep emails.md clean - only email copy, subject lines, sequence notes, and AI placeholders.

1. **Email Sequence File** (`emails.md`)
   - Contains only the email sequence
   - Email body must be **plain text only** (no markdown formatting except external links)
   - Use proper email structure (Subject, Body, etc.)
   - Include placeholders for AI variables: `{{Variable Name}}`
   - If A/B test defined: include variant sections for affected emails (see below)

2. **Notes File** (`notes.md`)
   - **Target ICP**: Who this is for
   - **Goal & Angle**: What we're trying to achieve and approach
   - **Pain Point Focus**: Core problem being addressed
   - **Campaign Strategy Alignment**: How the copy aligns with the provided strategy (if applicable)
   - **Summary of Changes**: (Only when improving existing copy) Brief list of what was changed and why

3. **AI Personalization Prompts File** (`prompts.json`) - **Only when AI variables are specified**
   - JSON array of prompt objects
   - Each prompt corresponds to an AI variable from the campaign strategy
   - See `ai_prompts_format.md` for detailed structure

### Email and Variant Naming

Every email in `emails.md` MUST have a short descriptive title in its heading, whether or not it has A/B variants. These titles flow downstream into `campaign-configuration`, which uses them as the step `name` field in the EmailBison sequence editor (mirroring how names are edited in the Ken AI frontend).

**Email heading format:** `## Email N: {short title}` - e.g., `## Email 1: Offer`, `## Email 2: Bump`, `## Email 3: Case Study`, `## Email 4: Final Nudge`. Describe the email's angle/role, not generic labels like "Step 1" or "Email One".

**Variant heading format (when A/B testing):** `### Variant A ({short description})` - the parenthetical description is required and should name what makes this variant different (e.g., `(With PS)`, `(No PS)`, `(Short Body)`, `(Static Subject)`). Downstream, campaign-configuration combines the email title and variant description into the step name.

**ALWAYS use the literal word `Variant`, never `Version`.** Use it consistently for every email in the sequence including the closing email - do NOT switch to `### Version A` / `### Version B` for later emails in the sequence even if it feels more natural semantically. The campaign-configuration parser accepts `Version` as a fallback alias but emitting it is a drift signal and loses schema consistency. One word, always: **Variant**.

**Hard length rule:** the final combined step name (title or `title - variant`) MUST be ≤25 characters. Examples that pass: `Offer - With PS` (15), `Bump` (4), `Case Study - Short` (18). Examples that fail: `The Offer - With PS Line` (24 chars and still clunky - prefer `Offer - With PS`), `Follow-up Bump` is fine alone but `Follow-up Bump - Short Body` (27) is too long, shorten to `Bump - Short`. Abbreviate aggressively; clarity for the CSM matters more than full-word titles.

### A/B Test Variants in emails.md

When strategy.md defines sequence tests, affected emails include variants:

```markdown
## Email 1: The Offer

### Variant A (With PS Line)

**Subject**: {{Subject Line}}

**Body**:
```
Hey {firstName},

{{First Line}}

We'll send personalized emails to 5,000 of your ideal clients...

Want me to walk you through how it works?

{sender_signature}

{{PS Line}}
```

### Variant B (No PS Line)

**Subject**: {{Subject Line}}

**Body**:
```
Hey {firstName},

{{First Line}}

We'll send personalized emails to 5,000 of your ideal clients...

Want me to walk you through how it works?

{sender_signature}
```

**Test Notes**:
- Primary metric: Reply rate
- Hypothesis: PS line may dilute the focused offer message
- Difference: Variant B removes PS line, ends at CTA
```

**Format rules for variant emails:**
- Each variant gets its own section (### Variant A, ### Variant B) - ALWAYS `Variant`, NEVER `Version`, for every email in the sequence
- Include a short variant description in parentheses naming what varies (`With PS Line`, `No PS Line`, `Short Body`). Avoid noise words like "Control" / "Test" - downstream uses this text verbatim as the step name suffix.
- Copy body differences are the ONLY change (same Subject line format unless testing subject)
- Add "Test Notes" at end summarizing the test
- Unaffected emails keep normal format (no variant sections), but still need a descriptive `## Email N: {title}` heading

### Writing Style
- **Be concise** - Don't overload context
- Use numbers over words: "40-50%" not "forty to fifty percent"
- Use symbols and abbreviations where appropriate
- Every word must earn its place

### Workflow
- **Expect iteration** - This is a conversation, not a one-shot
- Be ready to make improvements based on user feedback
- When revising, update the Summary of Changes in the notes file

### Campaign Strategy Integration Workflow
When a Campaign Strategy document is provided:

1. **Parse the Input**: Extract the email sequence blueprint and AI variables
2. **Write Email Copy**: For each email in the sequence:
   - Follow the `primary_goal` and `description` from the blueprint
   - Respect the `delay_in_days` for sequence timing
   - Insert AI variable placeholders where specified (e.g., `{{First Line}}`, `{{PS Line}}`)
3. **Match AI Variables**: Use placeholders that match the prompts.md file (if in workflow mode)
4. **Output**: emails.md (notes.md merged into strategy.md in workflow mode)

### Workflow Mode (Segment Folder)
When invoked with a segment folder path:

1. **Read inputs from segment folder**:
   - `{segment_folder}/strategy.md` - Email sequence blueprint
   - `{segment_folder}/prompts.md` - AI personalization prompts (already generated)
2. **Write email copy**: Follow the strategy blueprint exactly
3. **Match variable names**: Use the exact placeholder names from prompts.md
4. **Output emails.md only**: Notes are not needed (strategy.md has that context)
5. **Skip prompts.json**: Already generated by prompt-writer skill

## Resources

For detailed guidance on specific topics, see the following reference files:

- **email_copywriting.md** - How to write email copy including hooks, body, CTAs, signatures, and PS lines

**Moved to other skills:**
- AI personalization prompts → `prompt-writer-skill/references/prompt-engineering.md`
- Building block philosophy → `campaign-strategy-skill/references/building-blocks.md`
- Review workflow, QA checklists, exercises → `email-review` skill

## Output Handling

After generating the email copy:

### If segment folder specified (workflow mode):

1. **Write emails.md**: Save to `{segment_folder}/emails.md`
2. **Confirm**: Tell the user emails are saved to the segment folder
3. **Report**: Summarize the campaign completion (strategy, filters, prompts, emails all done)

### If standalone mode:

1. **Return inline**: Present all outputs concatenated inline to the user using this format:

   ```
   # Emails

   [emails.md content]

   ---

   # Notes

   [notes.md content]

   ---

   # AI Prompts

   [prompts.json content]
   ```

## Edit Mode (Improvement Context)

When invoked with improvement context (`mode: "edit"`), this skill edits existing emails.md rather than generating new copy.

### Detecting Edit Mode

Check for improvement context in the conversation:
- `mode: "edit"` indicates edit mode
- `trigger: "analytics"` or `trigger: "feedback"` indicates source
- `improvement_instruction` contains specific changes to make

### Edit Mode Workflow

1. **Read improvement context**: Extract `improvement_instruction` object
2. **Load existing emails.md**: Read current email copy from campaign folder
3. **Identify scope**: What specifically to change (see scope table below)
4. **Apply targeted changes**: Only modify what's specified
5. **Generate diff**: Show before/after comparison
6. **Get approval**: Wait for user to confirm changes
7. **Save**: Update emails.md with approved changes
8. **Log**: Update improvement-log.md in plan folder

### Handling Edit Scopes

| Scope | Action | What Changes |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| "Email 1 subject" | Modify Email 1 subject line only | Subject line text |
| "Email 3 body" | Modify Email 3 body text only | Body content |
| "All subjects" | Modify all subject lines | All subject lines |
| "All CTAs" | Modify call to action in all emails | CTA sentences |
| "Tone adjustment" | Rewrite with new tone | All body text |
| "Full rewrite" | Generate new copy from strategy.md | Everything |

### Edit Mode Output Format

```markdown
## Proposed Changes to emails.md

### Email 3 Subject Line

**Before:**
Subject: {{Subject Line}}

**After:**
Subject: Quick q about {company}

**Rationale:** Less AI-heavy subject line to test if personalization is causing fatigue

Approve these changes? [Yes/No/Modify]
```

### Preserving Context During Edits

When editing:
- **Keep unchanged emails intact**: Don't touch emails not in scope
- **Maintain placeholder names**: Use exact same AI variable names
- **Preserve email structure**: Keep delays, numbering, format
- **Respect strategy.md**: Changes should align with campaign goals

### Analytics-Informed Editing

When `analytics_context` is provided:
- Reference `sequence_stats` to understand email-specific performance
- Use `weak_spots` to focus improvements
- Consider `sibling_comparison` for what worked elsewhere

### Feedback-Informed Editing

When `feedback_context` is provided:
- Address specific client/CSM concerns
- Match tone to feedback type (e.g., "too pushy" = softer approach)
- Document feedback in improvement-log.md

### Edit Mode Checklist

Before saving edits, verify:
- [ ] Only specified scope was modified
- [ ] AI variable placeholders match prompts.md
- [ ] Email structure preserved
- [ ] Changes align with improvement rationale
- [ ] Diff shown and approved by user
